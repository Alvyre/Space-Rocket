    - Check if the file `LeapJava.jar` is located to the good leapmotion lib OS folder
    - Check if `Native location library` is configurated with the good leapmotion lib OS folder

## Prior installation

You have to download [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and buy a [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) and a [MIDI Controller](https://www.arturia.com/products/hybrid-synths/beatstep). If you don't have neither LeapMotion nor MIDI Controller, you can play with your keyboard. ðŸ˜Ž
